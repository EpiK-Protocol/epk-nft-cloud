# EpiK Protocol NFT Cloud

This project aims to build a free and even rewarded decentralized storage service based on EpiK Protocol to store valuable NFT data in Ethereum / BSC.

## Background

In the last quarter, the NFT market transaction volume has soared to 10.7 billion US dollars. However, in the current huge NFT market, there is still a lack of decentralized free permanent storage services. The mainstream NFT creation tutorial recommends Pinata.Cloud which requires payment by time. We need to make a difference.

## Our Goal

We hopes to build the first rewarded decentralized NFT storage service in IPFS ecosystem via applying to be the NFT domain expert in EpiK Protocol network.
